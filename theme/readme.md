##
Boilerplate for creating a new theme for your Sitecore site. 

## <p style="color:red">For this version of the theme we recommend to use [@sxa/cli](https://sitecore.myget.org/feed/sc-npm-packages/package/npm/@sxa/CLI) rather than gulp tasks</p>

## Prerequisites

1. Should be installed [@sxa/cli](https://sitecore.myget.org/feed/sc-npm-packages/package/npm/@sxa/CLI) globally.  


## For using Autosynchronizer, you need to complete next steps:

1. Download the theme boilerplate;
2. Open *PathToInstance/Website/App_Config/Include/z.Feature.Overrides* (in previous version of Sitecore it can be *PathToInstance/Website/App_Config/Include/Feature*) folder and remove **.disabled** from **z.SPE.Sync.Enabler.Gulp.config.disabled** file;
3. Switch to the downloaded theme boilerplate folder.
4. run `sxa init`
5. Update the config file for Gulp tasks. **ThemeRoot/gulp/config.js** file:
    1. `serverOptions.server` - path to sitecore instance. Example `server: 'http://sxa'`;
6. If you use Creative exchange skip this step. Open **ThemeRoot/gulp/serverConfig.json** 
     1. `serverOptions.projectPath` - path to project, where the theme is placed. Example ` projectPath: '/themes'`;
    2. `serverOptions.themePath` - path to basic theme folder from the project root. Example ` themePath: '/Basic2'`;
7. Open the Theme root folder with the command line.
8. Run `npm install` (*node.js and npm should be installed already *);
9. If gulp is not yet installed - Install gulp using following command: `npm install --global gulp-cli` 
10. Run the gulp task that you need: <br/>
